If you want to build the docker image on your system then make sure you have both Docker and Git installed on your system.

First we need to clone our code to do this run ``` git clone https://github.com/unofficial-skills/alpha-video ```. This dowload the code to the system. We need to open that directory ``` cd alpha-video ```
