To install Alpha-Video on your Unraid machine you need to open the Apps-Tab which you can access if you have Community-Applications (CA) installed.

* Enter in the Search Alpha-Video to find the Application.
* Select the Image by Kippenhof and Press Download.

In the Template you will find 1 Variable and one Port.

* The Port you configure doesn't matter, since the App is using the Service [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).
:::caution Running this App over your own Domain is currently not supported. :::

* The Subdomain you configure should be **over 3 Characters**. If Someone allready uses your adress, a random one will be generated and shown to you in the Container-Logs.

After you are done with the Configuration you can hit "Apply" and Continue [HERE](https://alpha-video.andrewstech.me/docs/doc4)
