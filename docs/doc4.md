Now we have the domain we can head over to the Alexa developer console. We can access it by clicking [here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).
Make sure to sign in with the amazon account you use with alexa. Once signed in click the blue create skill button. Enter a skill name this can be anything. Make sure custom model and Provision your own are selected.

On the next page choose start from scratch.  On the left side click on endpoints. Now scroll down and click on https. Now in the Default Region box paste your domain. Make sure it starts with https. Add /api to the end of the domain. 

The domain should now look like this ``` https://pretty-mayfly-37.loca.lt/api ``` . In the dropdown box below make sure to select  ``` My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority ```.
