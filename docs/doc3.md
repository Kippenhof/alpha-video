For this project you will need a ngrok account. Ngrok allows opening the skill to the internet without portforwarding. This is required as alexa will only allow requests to be sent to valid domains.
In this case ngrok will  give us a free random subname to use.

# Create the account

[Click here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) to signup for ngrok. Once your account is setup scrole down to find your auth token. If you can't see it then click [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

Copy this down as we will need this later.


:::tip On the free plan Ngrok will give you a diffrent subname on every restart.
