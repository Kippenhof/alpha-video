Once Docker is fully installed and running. Open a terminal on your device. I use powershell on windows. 

There is a few different versions of the docker image use the command bellow that matches your language. 

English: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name alpha-video -p 5000:5000 andrewstech/alpha-video:latest

More lanugages to come.

That command downloads the latest version of the code and runs it in a virtual environment.
